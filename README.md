# Pose Detection Using MediaPipe and OpenCV

## Overview
This script uses MediaPipe's Pose module and OpenCV to perform real-time pose detection from webcam input. It identifies and draws pose landmarks on live video frames, enabling the visualization of human body movements.

## Features
- **Real-Time Pose Detection**: Detects and tracks body landmarks using a webcam.
- **Pose Landmarks Visualization**: Draws detected landmarks and connections on the video feed.
- **Interactive Control**: Press 'd' to exit the application.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- `opencv-python`
- `mediapipe`

Install them with:
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
